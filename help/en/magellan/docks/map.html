    <h1>Karte</h1>
    <p>Here the map of the known world is displayed.</p>
    <p style="text-align: center">
      <img src="../images/windows_map.gif" alt="" border="0" />
    </p>
    <p>
      When "Fog of War" (FOW) is enabled, regions that do not contain units or
      have not been traveled through, as well as ocean regions that can not be
      glimpsed from atop a lighthouse, are displayed darker. This mode can be
      toggled with shortcut key
      <kbd class="short">Ctrl+W</kbd>
      .
    </p>
    <p>If you click on the map the selected region is opened in the region
      view. By holding down the mouse button you can pan the map.</p>
    <p>
      Above the map there is a zoom bar that controls the magnification of the
      map. Additionally you might find two drop-down menus here. One for
      planes, if you happen to have units in several planes, and one that
      allows you to choose so-called hotspots. You can add a hotspot by
      pressing
      <kbd class="short">Ctrl+H</kbd>
      and entering a name. By doing this you save the current map position and
      can go back to it at any time through the drop-down menu. If you are at
      an existing hotspot, you can delete it by pressing
      <kbd class="short">Ctrl+ALT+H</kbd>
      .
    </p>
    <p>
      You can select a region with
      <kbd class="short">Ctrl+right click</kbd>
      , or several with the mouse button held down. This way you can for
      example select regions to export as a CR. To deselect, use
      <kbd class="short">Ctrl+right click</kbd>
      again. You may also select the current region by pressing the space bar.
    </p>
    <p>Right clicking a region results in a context menu that has the
      following options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Change selection state</b><br /> Allows you to select and
        deselect the current region as with <kbd class="short">Ctrl+right
          click</kbd>.</li>
      <li><b>Copy name and coordinates</b><br /> Copies the name and
        coordinates to the clipboard.</li>
      <li><b>Set origin to this region</b><br /> Sets the origin of the
        coordinate system to the current region. This only applies to the
        display, a matching ORIGIN order is not issued to any unit.</li>
      <li><b>Set or delete hotspot</b><br /> Sets or deletes a hotspot
        corresponding to the current region. The name of the hotspot is set to
        the region's name.</li>
      <li><b>Signs</b><br /> You may add signs to a region on the map.
        Signs are displayed on the map and may help you to remember important
        information.</li>
      <li><b>Tooltips and Renderer</b> You can select which tooltip is
        displayed while hovering over a map region. You can also select how
        regions are rendered in the map. You can find more information on map
        renderers in the section about<a
        href="../menus/extras/options_map.html">map options</a>. You may also
        choose between available tooltips, texts, and region renderers quickly
        by pressing <kbd class="short">Alt+Shift+P</kbd>, <kbd class="short">Alt+Shift+A</kbd>
        , and <kbd class="short">Alt+Shift+R</kbd>, respectively.</li>
