    <h1>Region Overview</h1>

    <p>In the region window all units and regions are displayed in a tree.
      The tree's structure is set up as follows, in descending order:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Islands</li>
      <li>Regions</li>
      <li>Factions / Buildings / Ships / Streets</li>
      <li>Units</li>
    </ol>

    <p align="center">
      <img src="../images/windows_region.gif" alt="" border='0' />
    </p>

    <p>
      Nodes that have units with <a href="orders.html">unconfirmed orders</a>
      are shown in bold. The display of the region window can be adjusted to
      your tastes in the <a href="../menus/extras/options_region.html">options</a>.
    </p>

    <p>Units have a context menu that can be opened by right-clicking on
      them. This menu has the following options:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><b>Copy ID</b> Copies the unit's ID to the clipboard.</li>
      <li><b>Copy ID and name</b> Copies the unit's ID and name to the
        clipboard.</li>
      <li><b>Copy ID and name and person count</b> Copies the unit's ID
        and name, as well as the number of persons in it to the clipboard.</li>
      <li><b>Disguise unit</b> Creates the following orders to disguise
        the unit: <kbd class="orders">
          NUMBER UNIT <br /> NAME UNIT ""<br /> DESCRIBE UNIT ""<br /> HIDE
          FACTION
        </kbd><br /> The old values are inserted as persistent comments, so that you
        can fairly easily undo this action.</li>
      <li><b>Add to island/Remove from island</b><br />This may be used
        to group regions.
      <li><b>Order ships</b><br />You can give orders to the captains of
        one or more ships.</li>
      <li><b>Ship route planner</b><br />Used to create one-time or
        repeating route orders for one or more ships.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The faction node has an <b>alliance status icon</b> that shows your HELP
      status to this faction. Green squares mean this HELP status is set, red
      squares mean it's not. The squares have the following meaning: silver,
      combat, give, guard, faction stealth. Your own faction's squares are
      shown in blue.
    </p>

    <p>When you select several units, the context menu (right click)
      contains the entry "Add orders". This opens a dialog to add the same
      orders to all units.</p>
