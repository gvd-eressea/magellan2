    <h2>Bugs in Magellan</h2>

    <p>
      For us as developers the error messages are a good start when tackling a
      problem. These can be found in the
      <kbd>errors.txt</kbd>
      file in the Magellan folder; please include these error messages if you
      have a problem with Magellan. To reproduce an error it may prove
      necessary to send in (an excerpt of) the used CR. These CRs are of course
      handled confidentially, and will be deleted after the issue has been
      resolved.
    </p>

    <h3>Feature wishes = further development</h3>

    <p>We try to develop Magellan according to the wishes of its users. Our
      bug tracker helps enormously in this, because all feature wishes are
      centrally and publicly available.</p>
